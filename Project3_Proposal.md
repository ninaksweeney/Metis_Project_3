# Title

Amtrak has been America's railroad for exactly 50 years. A for-profit, state-owned company, Amtrak has never in its history turned a profit. In fact, it can attribute much of its survival to the over [$40 billion of subsidies](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072115/how-amtrak-works-makes-money.asp) it's received from state and federal governments. Amtrak competes with speedy airlines, comfortable car travel, and cheap buses for ridership around the country. In the only year it was expected to be profitable, 2020, COVID ravaged the company, and it continues to experience extremely low ridership.    

However, inherent to Amtrak is a compelling opportunity. As we live through a perilous climate crisis, young people are widely affected by climate anxiety and feel moved to make personal changes. There is an urgent need to provide alternatives to carbon-heavy air travel, and Amtrak is poised to be the solution. With record low ridership, Amtrak has published a [5-year plan](https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/corporate/businessplanning/Amtrak-Service-Line-Asset-Line-Plans-FY21-26.pdf) to not only retain current riders but target new, younger customer segments. Amtrak can use data science approaches to identify opportunities & reach their target audience, positioning themselves as the best option for climate-conscious travelers.   

## Question/Need  

Primary problem: 
- Extremely low Amtrak ridership - it is not beating out other options  
Secondary, motivating problem: 
- Major dependence on carbon-heavy air travel to traverse the U.S.

**Where should Amtrak use its marketing money in order to increase ridership among young people?**  

We can use data science in multiple areas:
- Identifying the most popular air travel routes in the U.S. where Amtrak already has an alternative route
- Identifying potential travelers who are climate-conscious and may be receptive to using an alternative 

## Data Description    
Data to inform geographical analysis:  
- [Flight data](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/databases.asp?Z1qr_VQ=E&Z1qr_Qr5p=N8vn6v10&f7owrp6_VQF=D) for the past couple of years can be downloaded from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics  
- [Annual Amtrak Ridership](https://www.railpassengers.org/resources/ridership-statistics/) data by route will need to be manually scraped from the Rail Passengers Association (no other data source has it available)  

Data to target potential users:
- [College & University data](https://educationdata.urban.org/data-explorer/colleges/) from the Ubran Institute. Potentially target schools with large environmental programs or that are in geographies affected by climate change. 
- Searching for other potential options here - open to ideas.
