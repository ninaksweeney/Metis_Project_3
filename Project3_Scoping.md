## Problem Statement
Amtrak needs a strategy to improve its historically low ridership and revenue, which have been made worse by the onset of COVID-19.


## Nontechnical Scoping

Opportunity :  
   
Amtrak is a low-carbon alternative to air travel, which may appeal to younger audiences - a key demographic that Amtrak is trying to target.   

Impacted Parties :   
* Amtrak marketing team 
* Amtrak staff on chosen routes 
* Politicians writing policy related to Amtrak
* Amtrak finance team, Station staff and surrounding tourism-related business
* Airline staff in affected areas  

Main Constraints :   
* Amtrak is currently sustained with subsidies, so marketing budget must not exceed its annual allowance
* Amtrak staff will need to adjust to changes in ridership, so advertising should ramp up slowly

Other Considerations :  
  
Amtrak faces a number of major obstacles at the moment. This project addresses a combination of ridership & revenue, but not challenges like crumbling infrastructure, COVID-19 dangers, or Congressional hurdles. All of those other challenges will affect our solution in known & unknown ways. 

## Technical Scoping

Potential Solution Paths :  
* EDA to drill down to (assumed) potential target audience
* Prediction model to identify who is most likely to replace other forms of travel with rail (collect data on this at the ticket purchase time)
* Model which routes, days, times, etc. produce the highest ROI for Amtrak 
* Model which routes, days, times, etc. are the best environmental options compared to airlines

Data Sources :  
* [Air travel data, last three years](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FHK&QO_fu146_anzr=b4vtv0%20n0q%20Qr56v0n6v10%20f748rB)

* Needed from amtrak : Data on new ticket purchasers - demographics, geography, and other potentially predictive factors
* Other data, such as route durations and prices, can be manually collected from the website

## Impact Hypothesis  
  
Climate-focused advertising targeted at young people who travel often will increase ridership and revenue for Amtrak.
