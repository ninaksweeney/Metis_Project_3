## Problem Statement
Amtrak needs a strategy to improve its historically low ridership and revenue, which have been made worse by the onset of COVID-19.


## Nontechnical Scoping

Opportunity :  
   
Amtrak is a low-carbon alternative to air travel, which may appeal to younger audiences - a key demographic that Amtrak is trying to target.   

Impacted Parties :   
* Amtrak marketing team 
* Amtrak staff on chosen routes 
* Politicians writing policy related to Amtrak
* Amtrak finance team, Station staff and surrounding tourism-related business
* Airline staff in affected areas  

Main Constraints :   
* Amtrak is currently sustained with subsidies, so marketing budget must not exceed its annual allowance
* Amtrak staff will need to adjust to changes in ridership, so advertising should ramp up slowly

Other Considerations :  
  
Amtrak faces a number of major obstacles at the moment. This project addresses a combination of ridership & revenue, but not challenges like crumbling infrastructure, COVID-19 dangers, or Congressional hurdles. All of those other challenges will affect our solution in known & unknown ways.
